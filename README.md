## CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dataset

VIX time-series dataset consists of daily open, close, high and low. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is considered as a main factor for market expectations to indicate how much volatility is in the overall market conveyed by S&P 500 stock index option prices identified in 1993.
In this project, I made a model to predicte the price of the CBOE volatility index (VIX) using a time series analysis.

The project goes through the following steps:

• Exploring your data

• Forecasting VIX through Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)

• Model optimization using Neural Network, Linear Regression, Decision Tree & Random Forest.
